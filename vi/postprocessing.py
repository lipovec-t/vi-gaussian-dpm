# TODO - each of the following shall be represented by its own function
# full postprocessing that includes everything below, can be called in sim file 
# MAP estimator for cluster assignments
# MMSE estimator for cluster assigments?
# MMSE estimate for cluster means
# Sample mean of clustered data
# MAP estimator for cluster means?
# MMSE estimator for cluster weights
# MAP estimator for cluster weights?
# plot posterior (contour plot, only for K=2, maybe also include K=1)
# plot estimated cluster assignments, cluster means and cluster weights
