# Scenario Description

## Scenario 1
Files used:
- s1_simulate.py
- s1_config.py

This scenario is used for a simple simulation run to test the various settings.
One can try out different types of generated data (DPM, MFM, GM) as input to the algorithm
and also try different initializations (see config file for init settings and their description).
The config file (s1_config.py) stores all parameters that can be changed
and also serves as a documentation of all the settings that can be made.

## Scenario 2
Files used:
- s2_simulate.py
- s2_config.py

This scenario is used to simulate a simple object tracking scenario.
The data is generated by a DPM with parameters given by the config (s2_config.py)
where also noise is include in the process. Out of the noisy measurements $y=x+y$
the true object positions $x$ are tried to be recovered with an MMSE estimator
where a clustering for y is done beforehand with VI. Simulation is performed
multiple times and the average result with CI is used to compare to sampling technqiues.

## Scenario 3
Used for comparison to VI with MFM.
